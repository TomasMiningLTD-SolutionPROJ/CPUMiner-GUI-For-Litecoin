# CPUMiner-GUI-For-Litecoin
 Simple &amp; Easy Litecoin Mining GUI 

CPUMiner GUI was developed by using an open source ide called SharpDevelop & Visual Basic programming language. The reason I developed this is to understand how to redirect some appliication's output to VB list box control. So, I used a command-line Litecoin miner and using VB, I have redirected it
s output to my application. Then I named it as "CPUMiner GUI For Litecoin". I was able to learn what I wanted & then I closed this project. Now, since I wanted to learn about git, I decided to push this project to GitHub. 

If you are interested in this, feel free to use it as you want. I know this source is little bit messy. I'm sorry about that. 

Also, don't forget to let me know the improvements you did by a pull request.
